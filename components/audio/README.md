## Dependencies

You need [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv). The easiest way to install it is to get `pip`
and run `pip install --user pipenv`. If you get `pipenv: command not found` you might need to
log out and in again.

## Setup and Commands

The following commands are available:

| Command                     | Effect                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `make`                      | Run both `init` and `dev`                                                     |
| <code>make&nbsp;init</code> | Install dependencies                                                          |

## Running manually

Run the project with ```python main.py``` from the audio folder. Possible arguments are the following:
| Parameter         | Type   | Default value | Description                                            |

## Visual Studio Code configuration
There is a run configuration available for the audio module. Just open the entire repo folder in Visual studio code and
it should automagically know how to run etc. Yay!
